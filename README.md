A vehicle generation script for the Grand Theft Auto: IV Mutliplayer Mod. It can no longer be used (as the Mutliplayer Mod is obsolete) but I kept this script as it was one of my first proper scripts I have ever done! It was developed in a scripting language called Squirrel (similar to PAWN and LUA).

For archive (and sentimental) purposes only.
