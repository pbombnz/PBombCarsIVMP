For archive (and sentimental) purposes only 

A vehicle generation script for the Grand Theft Auto: IV Mutliplayer Mod. It can no longer be used (as the Mutliplayer Mod is obsolete) but I kept this script as it was one of my first proper scripts I have ever done! Obviously my coding skills were rubbish then, so don't question why I have two different files for essentially the same code.

There are two versions of the code: 
Random version - produces vehicles with random colours (Had a few more methods and features)
Non-Random version - produces vehicles with static colours.
